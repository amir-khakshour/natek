You are a freelancing backend developer, who was recently approached by Arthur, a young entrepreneur in the toys'n'games business. He has just started his business "Arthur's toys" with a unique approach to convert his customers. As a first step, he wants to present his goods through a website - unfortunately he is not very technical. He does not want to sell the goods through the website, though.

Arthur has hired you to build the backend, while his nephew Alex will provide the frontend. To present and manage his goods, Arthur requires only a single service that allows him to:

1.  He needs to be able to create, read, update, delete and list goods from the backend.
2.  His goods have the following characteristics that need to be presented:
    -   brand
    -   model
    -   category
    -   description
    -   price
    -   an image

**Tasks:**  
• Document how your service can be used (for frontend development).  
• Using either Go, Node.JS or Python develop the service endpoint.

  
Note: Feel free to use any framework from the mentioned programming languages above and any database you see to fit.
